-----1.. What is cloud?


Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and 
maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis 
from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

---- 2..Who is using Cloud?

	Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, 
virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud 
to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. 
And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.



---- 3.. Models of cloud services : 		
	1) SaaS	(Software as a Srvice)
	2) PaaS	(Platform as a Service)
	3) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)



**SaaS**
	
- Different softwares are provided directly, no need to download and install at client side.
- User is not responsible for hardware or software update.
- Can be used for short term projects that require quick and affordable collaboration. 

Examples : 
	Tableau, 
	Splunk,
	Storm,etc.

---

**PaaS**

- Instead of providing software, it provides platform for software creation.
- Developer has to focus only on software development without the worrying about O.S., Storage, Saoftware updates, etc.

Examples :
	Hosted db RDS.,
	AWS Elastic Beanstalk,etc.

---


**IaaS**

- Raw computing resources.
- Provides access to resources like - servers,storage and netwroking.

Examples :
	VM: Ec-2,
	Volume,etc.

**Benefits of cloud computing**

*Agility*
- The cloud gives you easy access to a broad range of technologies so that you can innovate faster and build nearly anything that you can imagine. 
You can quickly spin up resources as you need them–from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to Internet of Things,
machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.

- You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes, and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude faster than before. 
This gives you the freedom to experiment, test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences, and transform your business.

*Elasticity*
- With cloud computing, you don’t have to over-provision resources up front to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision 
the amount of resources that you actually need. You can scale these resources up or down to instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

*Cost savings*
- The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, 
the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale. 

*Deploy globally in minutes*
- With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy
 your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their 
experience.
