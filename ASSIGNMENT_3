ASSIGNMENT_3

- We can host our website using S3, only static pages can be uploaded.
- If you want to use dynamic pages, then need to use react js plain javascript won't work here.
- Charges for hosting depends on the size of file uploaded

### Url description of website hosted using S3 :

Example :

 https://100-bucket.s3-amazonaws.com/website/index.html
  
 1. *https://*                      -   protocol prefix ('s' represents secured)
 2. *100-bucket*                    -   Bucket Name 
 3. *.s3-amazonaws.com/*            -   Domain  
 4. *website/index.html*            -   Path of file

***Command for Remote login***

General command
       
       ssh username@ip-address   
- After this enter and provide password, you can login.
         
- But this method of username-password pair increases the chances of **Brute Force Attack** (anyone can pass all possible combinations of password and can hack the system).
- So,Linux uses the combination of private and public key arrived, while windows still use user-passwrd pair for authentication.
- This **public key is on AWS instance** in our case it is on ec2. 
- And **Pricate Key is nothing but the .pem** that is generated.

1. For windows  we are using Mobaxterm

- But, mobaxterm also uses the above shell command in backend, it is just that we cannot see it because we are using direct UI.

2. For Linux
       
       ssh -i <.pem>username@ip-address
